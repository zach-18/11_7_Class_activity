<h1> Hello World!!</h1>

<p>There are other more semantic HTML tags such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">articles</a> or
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav">navs</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer">footers</a> which behave the exact same way as div elements do, but are designed to be
  used for specifc purposes. These should be used whenever possible for a few reasons, but one of the most practical is that code is easier to understand and debug when things are named what they actually are.
